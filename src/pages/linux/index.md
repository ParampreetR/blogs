Linux is an operating system just like Windows that work on Computers as well as Phones but its open source. Open source means anyone can download and install Linux for free and moreover read and modify its source code too. It was based upon another Operating System UNIX. Linux get its name from &#39;UNIX&#39; and its developer &#39;Linus&#39; and his full name was Linus Torvalds. It is the most underrated OS.

Linux is one of the most powerful operating system. Android, a most popular OS for mobile devices, is based on Linux. Linux is too heavily used in Rockets, Cloud Servers, submarines and many more. According to data, till 2018 there were 500 Super Computers and all of them are equipped with Linux. Linux had now many contributors including Google, Samsung, Facebook, Intel, Red Hat. In today times Linux is available for any type of job. It is available in various flavors which we call distributions, most popular among them are Debian and Ubuntu. We can use suitable distribution of Linux for Graphics Designing, Development, Testing, Gaming, Learning or just casual desktop computer. Just like MS DOS in Windows, Linux had terminal but it had great set of powers lying behind.

Personally, I like 3 specialties of Linux. Firstly, no virus can infect Linux Computer, means user&#39;s most valuable data is safe. Secondly, most software can be installed by one command in terminal. No manual workload required. Third good thing about Linux is its efficiency. We can even install it on very old PC and still it will run at &#39;faster than light&#39; speed. Now we know Linux had a set of powers but learning how to work with Linux as professional takes time.

So, Linux can be used for everything. Its faster on old computers and its safe, with a huge
community support. There’s no way to doubt capabilities of Linux. Everyone should try Linux at
least once. This operating system is one which can be trusted rather than relying on Microsoft
which has been data breached several times (Recent one at Dec 28, 2019 exposed 250 million
Users Data to Criminals). Finally, I hope you saw this ‘small gem’ shining from far away
through the darkness and I’m sure you will take a close look one day. At last, a lot thanks to
Linux developers for providing such a great OS in tough competition with Windows.
